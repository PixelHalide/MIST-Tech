# Level 0

we have to ssh into the bandit server. i've used SSH several times before, so this isn't difficult. we have to specify a port in the ssh command, which we can do with a -p flag.

we simply do ***ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220**, which then prompts us for a password. after putting in the password, we successfully enter the machine.

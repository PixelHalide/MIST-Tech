# substitution2

## Challenge

It seems that another encrypted message has been intercepted. The encryptor seems to have learned their lesson though and now there isn't any punctuation! Can you still crack the cipher?

## Solving

just like the last challenge, we are met with garbled text. i put it into the substitution cypher solver and got the flag.

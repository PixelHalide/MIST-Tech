# substitution1

## Challenge

A second message has come in the mail, and it seems almost identical to the first one. Maybe the same thing will work again.

## Solving

just like the last challenge, we are met with garbled text. i put it into the substitution cypher solver and we get this flag:

picoCTF{FR3JU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_4871E6FB}

i tried putting this in as the flag, but it didn't work. i then noticed the "J" in FR3JU3NCY, which is out of place, since it's not leet speek and is not the correct spelling either. i changed it to Q and it worked.

## Flag

picoCTF{FR3QU3NCY_4774CK5_4R3_C001_4871E6FB}

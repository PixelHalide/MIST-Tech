# Insp3ct0r

## Challenge

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/ (link) or http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511

## Solving

The title of the challenge gives us the hint that we need to inspect element. I open the site and inspect element. I search for "pico" in the HTML and find the first third of the flag:

**picoCTF{tru3_d3**

I then go into the debugger section of the inspect window to the sources menu, Where I can see the JS of the website. there I find the third half.

**_lucky?832b0699}**

The last half is probably in the CSS then. I go into the style editor tab and look in the CSS. I find the comment with the last part.

**t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t**

combining them, we get the flag:

# Flag

**picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699}**
